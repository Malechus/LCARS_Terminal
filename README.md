# LCARS_Terminal
A Windows Terminal theme to mimic the LCARS interface from Star Trek: TNG

I included the entire setttings.json file for ease of use. Simply open the settings.json file in your Terminal client (CTRL+,) and copy/paste this version into it. Alternately, you can choose which portions of this file to take, like the color scheme; but this does use some general settings outside the scheme and profile.

You will also need to download the attached image and change the file path in line 35 to point to it. 

All in all, this should be a pretty simple process.

Engage!
